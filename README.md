# Objective-C
Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s. It is a superset of the C programming language and provides additional features for object-oriented programming, such as dynamic typing and runtime messaging. Objective-C was originally used for developing software for the NeXTSTEP operating system, which was later acquired by Apple and became the foundation for macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms.

Objective-C has a syntax that is influenced by both C and Smalltalk, and it supports features such as classes, objects, methods, protocols, categories, and dynamic typing. It uses a runtime system that allows for dynamic method resolution and late binding, which provides flexibility and dynamic behavior at runtime. Objective-C is known for its use of square brackets ([]) to send messages to objects, which is different from the dot notation (.) used in many other programming languages.

Objective-C has been widely used for developing software for Apple platforms, including macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It is the primary language used for developing native applications for Apple's platforms, and it is the language used for developing the frameworks and APIs provided by Apple for building software on its platforms, such as Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

Objective-C has been largely superseded by Swift, which is another programming language developed by Apple for its platforms. However, Objective-C code can still be used and integrated with Swift code in modern Apple software development, and many existing software libraries and frameworks written in Objective-C continue to be used in Apple software development. Objective-C is also used in some legacy codebases and in certain specialized contexts where its unique features and dynamic nature are still relevant.
